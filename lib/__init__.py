''' Library

PURPOSE: Organize a library of class, utility, stage, and setup
modules, which define commonly-used classes (i.e. objects) and
functions (i.e. actions).

Class modules define commonly-used object templates (e.g. dogs).
They usually identify specific object (instance) attributes (e.g.
name, age), define class methods (i.e. actions performed by object
instances) (e.g. speak name, roll over), and sometimes define class
variables (e.g. scientific name: Canis lupus familiaris).

Utility modules define one or more functions (i.e. actions) that
likely interact with several constants, variables, or objects.
