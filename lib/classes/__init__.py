''' Classes

PURPOSE: Organize a variety of class modules for commonly-used
objects.

Class modules define object templates (e.g. dogs). They
usually identify specific object (instance) attributes (e.g. name,
age), define class methods (i.e. actions performed by object
instances) (e.g. speak name, roll over), and sometimes define class
variables (e.g. scientific name: Canis lupus familiaris).

Superclasses are stored in this directory. Nested classes and
subclasses are stored in their related class directories.
